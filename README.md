📚 Gov-Connect Project Outline
📁 Root Directory: Gov-Connect-main/
Contains the overall project structure, likely a full-stack application with separate frontend and backend components.

1. 📂 server_/
Purpose:
This folder seems to contain the backend services for the Gov-Connect application.

Likely contents:

API endpoints

Business logic for handling service requests

Middleware and routing

Database connection logic

Possibly Express (Node.js)

2. 📂 unified-service-point-main/
Purpose:
This folder appears to be the frontend of the application.

Likely contents:

React app files (src/, public/, etc.)

package.json and package-lock.json for managing dependencies

User interface for citizens to access and submit service requests

Calls to backend APIs

🔗 How Components Work Together
The frontend provides an interface for users to interact with government services.

The backend receives requests from the frontend, processes them (possibly storing in a database or communicating with external systems), and sends back responses.

Communication is likely done over RESTful APIs.
